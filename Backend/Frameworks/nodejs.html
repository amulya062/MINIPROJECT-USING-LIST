            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used in Chrome. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for building scalable and real-time applications. It uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations, allowing it to manage multiple concurrent requests efficiently.Node.js is commonly used for server-side development, creating APIs, and building command-line tools. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager), which simplifies the development process. Key features include its ability to handle I/O operations efficiently, its support for various protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP, and its compatibility across different operating systems. Node.js is not a framework, but rather a runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting.
